# üêö Echoes Git/Bash Prompt Setup

This repo‚Äôs for the htb folks that ask for it.

Contains a install.sh script that can be executed without looking at it and it will replace some of your acutal stuff so read things.

It contains some useful aliases for htb machines like: connectvpn, stopvpn, htbip, addhost (to /etc/hosts) etc.

The git prompt will track the current directory's git branch status and display some symbols like in this image:
